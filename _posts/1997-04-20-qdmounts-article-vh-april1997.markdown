We were featured in Varmint Hunter Issue 22!

Excerpt:

"These mounts are heavy duty and allow the shooter to change scopes in about three seconds. I timed it, and it's about the quickest, slickest QD mount ever. Not only is it fast, but the Talbot scope mount returns to absolute zero every time. Scope removal and replacement is almost instantaneous and return to zero is exact."
