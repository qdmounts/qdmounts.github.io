We were featured on Sniper's Paradise!

Excerpt:
"Our test results were excellent. Groups repeatedly impacted in the same location. The average shot to shot and group to group deviation was nothing more than the standard difference expected. Things like the slight change in cheek weld from group to group and variations in each round fired were about all we saw. Every time we pulled off a scope and re-mounted it, the impact was the same. The time required to change scopes proved to take less than five seconds and is very simple. These mounts proved to us they work!"
