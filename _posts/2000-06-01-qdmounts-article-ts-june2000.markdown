Excerpt:
"Al Talbot's "Split Second" QD Mount solves each of the problems I see in QD mounts on the market today, and it solves all needs that I would personally want in such a mount. I can detach the scope in milliseconds, and I can change scopes out in about three seconds. Stress is in the axial plane, and the scope truly does return to zero."
