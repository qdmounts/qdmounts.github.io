Excerpt:
"Talbot QD Split Second Mounts ... are extremely high quality in material and execution of design, which qualifies them in the first teir of sniper rifle components ... my tests reveal the mounts, slide and rings are made of high quality materials, are extremely well made and always return the rifle to zero after removing and replacing the scope between shots."
