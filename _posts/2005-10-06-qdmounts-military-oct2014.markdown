The Talbot line of combat accessory mounting systems is now available for purchase through the GSA Advantage! (GSAAdvantage.gov/) website and catalog.

Press release:

FLINT, MI. (PRWEB) October 6, 2005

General Service Administration's (GSA) recent approval of Talbot QD Mounts has made it even easier for federal customers to purchase the company's flagship, quick detachable (QD) combat accessory mounting systems.

"Inclusion in GSA Schedule provides an outstanding opportunity for our organization," said Talbot QD Mounts President Al Talbot. "Moreover, our customers in government will enjoy streamlined access to our products."

Talbot's popular "QD mounts" are used in a variety of combat situations. The removal and replacement of optics, for example, while maintaining absolute zero affords military personnel an unmatched advantage over fixed mount or other similar mounting systems. "Ultimately, these systems enhance capabilities of the individual soldier," Talbot said. "Our military men and women are able to conduct and often switch between long range and close quarters duties, including night vision and thermal imaging, with increased efficiency."

The mounting systems are listed on the GSA-managed website, [GSA Advantage!](http://www.gsaadvantage.gov/), which serves as a catalog for products listed on GSA contracts. Online access to contract ordering information, terms and conditions and up-to-date pricing are available on the site. Talbot products are listed on Schedule 84.
