We offer a large selection of bases for rifles, plus a few revolvers.

### Product list

<div class="mobile-side-scroller">

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Product</th>
      <th><span class="option">Options</span> and <span class="price">Price</span></th>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
{% for item in site.data.receiver_adapters %}
  {% include product_list.html %}
{% endfor %}

  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

### Additional Information

You can request special configurations as well as unlisted rifles. We routinely augment the list or make custom bases upon request. We prefer
a receiver/action we can measure ourselves. Either the same model, from our local shop, or a rifle you send for us to measure. In the latter
case we mount the base and collimate scope at no additonal cost.
